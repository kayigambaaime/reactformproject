Group 3: Understanding and Implementing State Management in Functional Components
Objective
The purpose of this assignment is to explore state management within React functional components. It covers the foundational concepts of state and React hooks (specifically `useState`), as well as how to build and manage forms in React. This document provides a theoretical overview of state, hooks, and conditional rendering.
Key Concepts
1. State in React
   - Definition: In React, "state" refers to data that changes over the componentâ€™s lifecycle. Managing state is crucial because it controls how data flows and updates within the component.
   - Why It Matters: State enables components to dynamically reflect the latest data, responding to user actions or other triggers, ensuring the app updates in real-time.
   - Example: In a form, the state could include the data entered in each input field, such as name, email, or age.

 2. Introduction to Hooks
   - What Are Hooks? React introduced hooks to provide functional components with state management and lifecycle features, which were previously only available in class components.
   - useState Hook:
     - Purpose: `useState` allows us to add state to functional components.
     - How It Works: It returns an array containing two values:
       1. The current state.
       2. A function to update that state.
     - Syntax:
       javascript
       const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
       
       - `state`: Current value of the state.
       - `setState`: Function to update the state.
       - `initialValue`: The initial value of the state variable.

3. Managing Component State and Rendering
   - React components automatically re-render when state updates occur.
   - This reactivity allows us to update UI elements in response to user interactions or external data changes.
   - For example, in a form component, updating the state with new input values will trigger a re-render, showing the latest data instantly.

Practical Assignment

As a practical exercise, the assignment involves creating a **simple form** in React with the following goals:

1. State Management with useState:
2. Handling Form Submission:
3. Conditional Rendering:
   
Implementation Steps

1. Setup and Import React: Initialize a basic React app and import `useState` from React.
2. Create the Form Component:
   - Define a function-based component that includes form fields for name and email.
   - Initialize state for form fields using `useState`.
3. Handle Form Changes:
   - Define an `onChange` handler to update state as users input data.
4. Submit Form:
   - Define an `onSubmit` handler to capture form data when submitted and update the submission state.
5. Implement Conditional Rendering:
   - Use conditional rendering to show a thank-you message after the form is submitted
  

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
